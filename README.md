### Lab1

Visual Recognition of handwritten digits using multiple classifiers like: SVM,kNN,NaiveBayes and an Eyclidean Classifier.

### Lab2

Speech Recognition using Hidden Markov Models and LSTM's.

### Lab3

Genre recognition and sentiment analysis for music files. We use spectogram and chromogram preprocessing for the files and then we apply CNN and Refression LSTMs for different sentiments.
